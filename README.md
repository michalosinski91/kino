Kino - Cinema

TODO:

- Contact Page - contact details, form, map (google or opensourcemap?)
- Component Animations
- Media Queries
- TIcketPurchaseForm - when film selection changes, the other fields clear the selection data, but the selectTime field does not rever to disabled status
- Money formatting helper
- Implement filter functionality once film DB is linked
- Aktualnosci - connect to CMS?
- Repertuar + Home Page - Improve layout - use grid
- Add tickets available number to film entries in calenar
- Get calendar day change to work
- loading states

Issues:

- Routing directly to a nested path (e.g. /film/1) results in 404 - check 'CatchAll' & 'Isomorphic' solutions
- Try swapping route to /repertuar/:id
